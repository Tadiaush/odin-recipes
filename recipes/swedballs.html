<h1>Swedish Meatballs</h1>
<p>Traditional Swedish food dish for the family.</p>

<h2>Integriends needed:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 slices of bread</li>
    <li>heavy cream</li>
    <li>butter</li>
    <li>small onion</li>
    <li>ground beef</li>
    <li>ground pork</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>Egg</li>
    <li>black pepper</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until light brown, about 10
        minutes. Transfer onion to a mixing bowl. </li>
    <li>Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in
        the mixing bowl. Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream.</li>
    <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon meat mixture per
        meatball; form into balls. Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning often, until browned, about 5
        minutes. Insides of meatballs will still be pink. Place browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken
        broth, and cover with foil.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove meatballs to a serving dish.
    </li>
    <li>Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into drippings until smooth. Gradually whisk in
        enough beef broth to total about 2 1/2 cups liquid. Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until
        thickened, about 5 minutes. </li>
    <li>Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve gravy with meatballs. </li>
